# Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics medals per capita charts

When you look at Olympic's official medal count, it is easy to find that countries with a larger population tend to sit on the top of the chart. Although there are limits to the number of athletes each country can send to the Olympic games, larger countries do have a bigger pool to choose the best of their athletes. Obviously there should be a fairer way to count the medals.

So what if we count the medals considering the population of each country? Which country wins the most medals per capita? That is what these charts are about.

The charts are created based on Edouard Mathieu's [idea](https://twitter.com/redouad/status/1418976240954978309) and [his project on GitHub](https://github.com/edomt/tokyo2020).
